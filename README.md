# GPT: Transformer-based Language Model

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer-based GPT model trained on the OpenWebText dataset. The model follows the architecture principles of the original GPT paper and is built using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to explore language modeling and text generation using modern deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Implements a Transformer-based architecture
- Pretrained on OpenWebText dataset
- Supports text generation and fine-tuning
- Built with PyTorch for flexibility and scalability

## Installation
To use this repository, first clone it and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Executer13/gpt.git
cd gpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the GPT model on your dataset, run:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```
Modify `configs/default.yaml` to change model hyperparameters and training settings.

### Generating Text
To generate text using a trained model, run:
```bash
python generate.py --model-checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.pth --prompt "Your text prompt here"
```

### Fine-Tuning
Fine-tune the model on a custom dataset using:
```bash
python fine_tune.py --dataset path/to/dataset
```

## Model Architecture
The model follows the standard Transformer-based GPT architecture, including:
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism
- Layer normalization
- Position-wise feedforward network
- Causal masking for autoregressive generation

## Dataset
The model is trained on OpenWebText, an open-source dataset designed to replicate OpenAIâ€™s WebText dataset. Users can replace this dataset with their own corpus for custom training.
